# MessagingApp

This is a small and simple messaging app project done for the purpose of practicing Web development.

In this web application **HTML**, **CSS**, **vanilla JS** are used in the front end.  
On the backend **ExpressJS** in **node.js** along with **MongoDB** and **Socket.IO** are used.

I have plans to implement this project using more tools such as AngularJ and ReactJS in the future.  
Also kindly ignore my not so good front end as I'm still trying to get better at front end designing :)

Feel free to let me know if you think something could be better with this project.
